# [Towards Robust Evaluations of Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09733)

## Sebastian Farquhar, Yarin Gal

### Contributions

* propose fundamental desiderata for future evaluations, which can be applied regardless of dataset
* analyse the shortcomings of existing widely used evaluations in continual learning
* show empirically that existing evaluations are biased towards prior-focused approaches
* propose new experimental designs which mitigate the issues of existing ones.

### Desiderata

* Cross-task resemblances
*
