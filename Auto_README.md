## Classics
- **Lifelong robot learning**, (1995) [[bib]](../bibtex_me.bib#L1-L10)  by *Thrun, Sebastian and Mitchell, Tom M*
``` 
Argues knowledge transfer is essential if robots are to learn control with moderate learning times
``` 
- **Catastrophic Interference in Connectionist Networks: The Sequential Learning Problem**, (1989) [[bib]](../bibtex_me.bib#L441-L447)  by *Michael McCloskey and Neal J. Cohen*
``` 
Introduces CL and reveals the catastrophic forgetting problem
```
