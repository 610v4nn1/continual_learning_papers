# Continual Learning Reading Group

## Schedule

Monday 1:30PM

## Categories

* Classics (papers before Deep Learning area. Motivates and sets the stage for Continual Learning)
* Influencials (well cited papers. More general contributions like proposing new desideratas, frameworks, evaluations, etc)
* Rookies (new papers. e.g. NeurIPS 2019, ICLR 2020 submissions)
* Prior-Focused Methods
* Dynamic Architectures
* Rehearsal Methods
* Meta-Continual Learning
* Lifelong Reinforcement Learning
* Relevants (non-continual learning papers that can help us. Generalization, Biology, Psychology, Meta-Learning, etc)

#### Abreviations

Continual Learning (CL)
Catastrophic Forgetting (CF)
